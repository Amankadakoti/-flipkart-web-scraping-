Flipkart Web Scraping Project
Project Overview
The Flipkart Web Scraping Project is a Python-based endeavor that focuses on automating the extraction of valuable product data from Flipkart, a leading e-commerce platform. By harnessing web scraping techniques, this project aims to collect essential product details such as names, prices, discounts, and more from Flipkart's expansive product listings.

Project Objectives
Develop a robust web scraping script using Python to facilitate the seamless retrieval of product data from Flipkart's dynamic web pages.
Efficiently extract pertinent information, including product titles, pricing, discount amounts, and other pertinent attributes.
Organize the scraped data into a structured format to facilitate further analysis and exploration.
Key Features
Web Scraping Expertise: Leveraging the capabilities of the requests library, the project will establish HTTP connections and acquire the HTML content of Flipkart's product pages.
Data Extraction: Harnessing the power of the BeautifulSoup library, the project will parse and navigate HTML content to extract specific data points, including product names, prices, and discounts.
Structured Data Storage: The extracted data will be stored in a suitable data structure, such as lists or dictionaries, and then persistently stored in a CSV file or a database for subsequent analysis.
User-Friendly Interaction: The project will offer a command-line interface that enables users to input search parameters and preferences, thus customizing the scraping process for specific products or categories.
Technology Stack
Python: The primary programming language employed for crafting the web scraping script.
requests Library: Employed for sending HTTP requests and retrieving web page content.
BeautifulSoup Library: Utilized to effectively parse and navigate HTML content, extracting the desired information.
Data Storage (CSV/Database): Adopting a suitable method for structuring and storing the scraped data for analysis.
Git and GitHub: Embraced as version control and project management tools to facilitate collaboration and transparency.
Usage Instructions
